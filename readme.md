# Chat (with Node.js) 
Implement a chat application (both client and server)

- You type a username and send it to the server
- It is now username (save it in localStorage)
- All the messages should have an author, time and text
- Implement an ability to create rooms (create / rename / join / delete)
- New user should see all prev messages in the room

In order to run the server locally, you need to go to the server cd server folder in the terminal and type npx nodemon src/index.js. Also, to run the client locally, go to cd client and npm start.
